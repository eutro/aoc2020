# AOC 2020

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2020,
[written in C](https://gist.github.com/williewillus/07f534b706262ccc67119ddc70b2bd75).

## Building

Well there's only one file here, `main.c` so just use your preferred C compiler on it I guess?

There's a Makefile so if you're lucky you can run `make` to build, then `./aoc` to run.
