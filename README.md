# AOC 2020

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2020,
[written in C](https://gist.github.com/williewillus/07f534b706262ccc67119ddc70b2bd75).

## Building

Run `make` and then run with `./aoc` or `./aoc <day...>`.

If you're using Emacs, you can call

<kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>aoc-all</kbd> <kbd>RET</kbd>

to execute all days, or

<kbd>M-x</kbd> <kbd>aoc-day</kbd> <kbd>RET</kbd> <kbd><day></kbd> <kbd>RET</kbd>

to execute a single day.
